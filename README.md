**### Build up smart agriculture using iot ### **

Smart agriculture is a broad term that collects ag and food production practices powered by Internet of Things, big data and advanced analytics technology. When we talk about IoT, we generally refer to adding sensing, automation and analytics technology to modern agricultural processes. The most common IoT applications in smart agriculture are:

ðŸŒ¾Sensor-based systems for monitoring crops, soil, fields, livestock, storage facilities, or basically any important factor that influences the production.
ðŸŒ¾Smart agriculture vehicles, drones, autonomous robots and actuators.
ðŸŒ¾Connected agriculture spaces such as smart greenhouses or hydroponics.
ðŸŒ¾Data analytics, visualization and management systems.
ðŸŒ¾Predictive modeling and planning.

**### Benefits of IoT in agriculture ### **
As in other industries, application of Internet of Things in agriculture promises previously unavailable efficiency, reduction of resources and cost, automation and data-driven processes. In agriculture, however, these benefits donâ€™t act as improvements, but rather the solutions for the whole industry confronting a range of dangerous problems.

**### IoT agriculture sensors ### **
Thereâ€™s a wide range of IoT sensors used in agriculture, including soil, humidity, moisture, light, air temperature, CO2, solar energy sensor, and many others. Installed throughout the fields, in the IoT-based monitoring systems, on smart agriculture vehicles and weather stations, sensors continuously collect data and bring visibility and control into agriculture operations.
The combination of data coming from diverse sensors allows farmers to build crop models and predict how crops will grow in the given conditions, integrate precision farming practices, create harvesting strategies, etc.

**### The purpose of Smart Farming ### **
Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology â€“ including big data, the cloud and the internet of things (IoT) â€“ for tracking, monitoring, automating and analyzing operations.

**### Smart Farming Benefits ### **
Smart farming helps farmers to better understand the important factors such as water, topography, aspect, vegetation and soil types. This allows farmers to determine the best uses of scarce resources within their production environment and manage these in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner
